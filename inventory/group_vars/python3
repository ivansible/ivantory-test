# Mitogen detects python on docker as /usr/bin/python (python2).
# When pip module creates virtual environment, it needs setuptools.
# Normally ansible runs pip3 for that but mitogen runner on target
# hits setuptools missing with python2 on target and fails with:
#   ImportError: u'pkg_resources' is present in the Mitogen importer blacklist,
#   therefore this context will not attempt to request it from the master,
#   as the request will always be refused.
#   Failed to import the required Python library (setuptools)
#   on target's Python /usr/bin/python".
# Fix: explicitly tell mitogen to use python3 on focal.
